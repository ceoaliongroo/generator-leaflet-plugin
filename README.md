# generator-leaflet-plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ceoaliongroo/generator-leaflet-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ceoaliongroo/generator-leaflet-plugin)

Create a skeleton to develop a [Leaflet Plugin](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html). Afer use the generator we recommed use the [Leaflet Plugin Guide](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html#develop-your-own).

### WIP - Disclosure

This plugin is Work in Progess, defining his archicture and also his implementation. It's not ready to use in live/production enviroments but if you want can try, test and contribute, will be great!.

### Requirements

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Usages

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-leaflet-plugin from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-leaflet-plugin
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo leaflet-plugin
```
